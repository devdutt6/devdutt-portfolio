# Replication

Checkout the config file for mongod in path `/etc/mongod.conf` in linux find your own config file according ti your os.
find for rule `storage:` and check `dbPath` field it will have value `/var/lib/mongo` if in linux or other according to your os.
Go in that folder create three new folders for a new replica set named `store1`, `store2` and `store3`.

### step OPEN:

Open new terminal.

### step START-SERVER

run command `mongod --port {2701{*>7}} --dbPath {PathToAnyoneFileFrom3WeCreated} --replSet {ReplicaSetId}` in that new terminal.

Repeat [OPEN](#step-open) and [START-SERVER](#step-start-server) three times with increasing port by one and using a new folder path of which we created.

In terminal connect to mongo service and run command

```mql
rs.initiate({
  _id: "<ReplicaSetId>",
  members: [
    { _id: "<uniqueIdInReplicaSet>", host: "hostWithPortToNode" },
    { _id: "<uniqueIdInReplicaSet>", host: "hostWithPortToNode" },
    { _id: "<uniqueIdInReplicaSet>", host: "hostWithPortToNode" },
  ]
})
```

To check replica state and its details about service use command `rs.status()`.
You can see which node is primary and which is secondary.

By default Secondary nodes do not have permission to either read or write permissions.
To allow secondary read connect to secondary after checking which node are secondary and run command `db.getMongo().setSecondaryOk()` and `db.getMongo().setSlaveOk()`.
