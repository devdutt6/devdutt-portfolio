og_description: MongoDB is a NoSQL database which supports scalability and durability with features like Sharding and replicas. Mongo supports horizontal scaling with sharding which unlocks ability to scale infinitly.

# Mongo Things

## Sharding

When your application receiving high rates of queries throughput or you are handling a large chunk of data which could be larger than the memory RAM itself then you have to think about scaling.
Basically there are two type of scaling

- vertical
- horizontal

#### Vertical Scaling

Means increasing the Memory, bandwidth of a single server. But it comes with cost and there is a practical maximum due to the hardware dependency.

#### Horizontal Scaling

Distributing the load over multiple machine is horizontal scaling but it comes with the complexity of managing multiple servers.

#### Now only listing terms and things to remember

- Replication

  - components: primary, secondary, arbitrar, voting
  - how mongo creates replicas and replicates the data on replica sets (`oplog`)
  - whys of replication (durability, availability, recovery, edging)
  - read about "`{`'w' 'majority' `}`"

- Sharding
  - what is sharding, collection level
  - why sharding
  - components(shard(as a replica), mongos, config server)
  - role of shardKey vs indexKey
  - how to create one shardKey
  - sharding strategies(hashed, ranged, zoned)

#### Capped Collections

Cap some collection to store limited number of documents.You can also specify maxSize of document in collection.

#### $bucket operator in aggregation

```mql
{
  $bucket: {
    groupBy: <expression>,
    boundaries: [<boundary1>, ... ],
    default: <defaultBoundary>,
    output: {
      <field> : { <accumulator>: <expression> }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Transactions in mongo

1. startSession
2. startTransaction
3. operations
4. commitTransaction or abortTransaction
5. endSession
