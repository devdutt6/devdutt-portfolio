# RxJS

![RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/generated/images/marketing/home/Rx_Logo-512-512.png)

> [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is a reactive extention library for javascript.

I didnt knew about this piece of tool util recently I saw it implemented in the one of the project I am working with [Networked](). Fireship made a video of its tutorial on youtube 6 years ago and I didnt even knew this existed, it would have literary saved a ton of time handling browser events across the components!

In the words of rxjs

> This of rxjs as the loadash for events

It allows handling of async events as collections. The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

- Observable: represents the idea of an invocable collection of future values or events. (An array which gets build overtime)
- Observer: is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
- Subscription: represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
- Operators: are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
- Subject: is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multi-casting a value or event to multiple Observers.
- Schedulers: are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.

## Quick start

To start create a html and javascript file and as per convention name it `index.html` and `script.js` then import the rxjs script from cdn with the link like below and our `script.js` in html.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/rxjs@^7/dist/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js"></script>
```

now we can access the rxjs in our script file so we can move ahead.

**Note**: I'm trying this out in pure **vanillaJs** but you can also try this in any javascript frontend library and framework and you will have easier time to implement if you are familiar.

Generally we add **listener on a button** click like

```js
element.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));
```

but with _rxjs_ it looks something like

```js
const { fromEvent } = rxjs;
const clicks = fromEvent(element, 'click');
clicks.subscribe((e) => console.log(e));
```

Now lets add the **counter** to button in conventional way it would look like this in vanilla js

```js
let count = 0;
element.addEventListener('click', () => {
  count += 1;
  console.log(`Clicked ${count} times`);
});
```

now with _rxjs_ we can write

```js
const { fromEvent, scan } = rxjs;
fromEvent(document, 'click')
  .pipe(scan((count) => count + 1, 0))
  .subscribe((count) => console.log(`Clicked ${count} times`));
```

pipe is just a function that takes any number of rxjs functions in it and executes it accordingly.
above code looks a bit complex if you dont know the _reduce_ function of array. Think of scan as _reduce_ what it does is it starts from 0 provided in second parameter in scan function and on each call it adds one to it.

Now you can go and start implementing below are just a examples for references.

### Examples

#### Ways to create Observables

##### with create method

```js
function observableFunction(observer) {
  // next emits the event with value
  observer.next('hello');
  observer.next('world');
}

const { Observable } = rxjs;
const observe = Observable.create(observableFunction);
// subscribe listens to the event
observe.subscribe((value) => print(value));
```

Generally you dont have to create observables like this manually this was just to show-case.

##### From promise

```js
const proxyApiCall = new Promise((res, rej) => {
  setTimeout(() => res('ok'), 2000);
});

const { from } = rxjs;
const observe = from(proxyApiCall);
observe.subscribe((v) => print(v));
```

**From** is a used to create a observable from the promise based function.

##### Timer like timeout

```js
const { timer } = rxjs;
const observe = timer(2000);
observe.subscribe(() => print('timer ran out'));
```

With the timer function the observable will fire on the completion of the timer.

##### Interval

```js
const { interval } = rxjs;
const observe = interval(2000);
observe.subscribe(() => print('IT ran out'));
```

With the interval the observable will fire on the every defined interval.

##### of

```js
const { of } = rxjs;
const observe = of('number', 20, ['dev', true], { name: 'devdutt' });
observe.subscribe((val) => print(val));
```

With of function we can create observable. This depicts that we can create it with any data type.

#### Hot vs Cold Observables

Cold are the observables which will generate the data from within.
**Observables dont generate value until something subscribes on it.**
When subscribers subscribe to such observables thinking each of them will get the same data but it might not depending on function of the observables.

```js
// COLD
const { Observable } = rxjs;
const cold = Observable.create((obs) => {
  obs.next(Math.random());
});
// subscriber listens to the event
cold.subscribe((value) => print(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)); // 0.98...
cold.subscribe((value) => print(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)); // 0.87...
```

Hot are the observables which will send the same data to every subscriber on calling the connect function after making the every subscription to the observables.

```js
// HOT
const { Observable } = rxjs;
const num = Math.random();
const hot = Observable.create((obs) => {
  obs.next(num);
});
// subscriber listens to the event
hot.subscribe((value) => print(`Subscriber 1: ${value}`)); // 0.98...
hot.subscribe((value) => print(`Subscriber 2: ${value}`)); // 0.98...
```

Above is a hot observable as every subscriber will get the same data.

#### Completion

```js
const { finalize, timer } = rxjs;
timer(2000)
  .pipe(finalize(() => print('All done!')))
  .subscribe();
```

This observable prints `All done!` when some action of event emission of if completed. At the end of its lifecycle.

```js
const { finalize, interval } = rxjs;
const observer = interval(1000).pipe(finalize(() => print('All done!')));
const listen = observer.subscribe();

// we are manually forcing unsubscribe so the
// the observer will be ended and finalize will get called
setTimeout(() => {
  listen.unsubscribe();
}, 4000);
```

---

#### Operators

##### map

```js
const { of, pipe, map } = rxjs;
const observer = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).pipe(map((val) => 10 * val));
observer.subscribe(print); // 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
```

`Map` does exactly what is suggests it loops over the values of observable and returns the new value to the subscriptions.

##### tap

```js
const { of, pipe, tap } = rxjs;
const observer = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).pipe(tap(print));
observer.subscribe(() => {});
```

Tap lets us run the side effect on the observables. Tap functions lets us Tap into the value of observable.

##### filter

```js
const { of, pipe, filter } = rxjs;
const observer = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).pipe(filter((val) => val & 1));
observer.subscribe(print);
```

`Filter` filter out the values on the based of pre condition and subscriber only gets the filtered value.

##### first, last

```js
const { of, pipe, first, last } = rxjs;
const observer = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).pipe(first());
const observer2 = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5).pipe(last());
observer.subscribe(print); // 1
observer2.subscribe(print); // 5
```

`first` and `last` returns the first and last value form the data stream.

##### debounceTime(last event)

```js
const { fromEvent, pipe, debounceTime } = rxjs;
const observer = fromEvent(document, 'click').pipe(debounceTime(500));
observer.subscribe((e) => print('clicked'));
```

##### throttleTime(first event)

```js
const { fromEvent, pipe, throttleTime } = rxjs;
const observer = fromEvent(document, 'click').pipe(throttleTime(500));
observer.subscribe((e) => print('ok'));
```

I dont think I need to explain throttle and debouncing.

##### scan

```js
const { fromEvent, pipe, scan } = rxjs;
const observer = fromEvent(document, 'click').pipe(
  scan((count) => count + 1, 0)
);
observer.subscribe((v) => print(`clicked ${v} times`));
```

`scan` is just like reduce function for array. With a difference that scan will accumulate the data stream from observable.

##### switchMap

`switchMap` is used to get the data from other observable first before sending the data to subscriber.

##### takeUntil

`takeUntil` is used to automatically unsubscribe when the expression is matched

##### takeWhile

`takeWhile` is used to automatically unsubscribe after the expression is failed to match.

##### zip, forkJoin, catch, retry

These are other useful operators provided by rxjs which are very useful but now I will not cover more!
