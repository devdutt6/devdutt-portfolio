# SCSS (called sassy CSS)

SCSS is basically batteries included CSS.

Every valid CSS is valids SCSS but can't be true otherwise.
Browsers can't understand SCSS so we have to compile it to CSS before deploying the projects, for which we use compilers.
In new Frameworks we don't have to configure SCSS and its compiler manually but have to if we are not using one.

## $variable

Variable is defined with `$` symbol followed by variable name eg. `$color` and then can use the variable as value eg.

```scss
$color: '#272727';
.main {
  background-color: $color;
}
```

above code will get complied into css like

```css
.main {
  background-color: '#272727';
}
```

## $map

Map is kind of object in javascript and dictionary in python. Map is also defined like variable with prefix `$`.
We can use it like as example shown below.

```scss
$colors: (
  'red': '#FF0000',
  'blue': '#0000FF',
  'green': '#00FF00',
);
.main {
  color: map-get($colors, 'red');
}
```

above code will be transpiled to

```css
.main {
  color: #ff0000;
}
```

## Nesting

We will better understand nesting with example

```scss
.main {
  p {
    /* targets <p> which  are child of .main */
    color: 'red';
  }

  &_paragraph {
    // .main_paragraph
    padding: 2px 8px;
  }

  #{&}_para {
    // .main .main_paragraph
    color: 'blue';
  }
}
```

above code will be transpiled to css like

```css
.main p {
  /* look how <p> tag is autmatically targeted with child specificity of main in CSS */
  color: 'red';
}

.main_paragraph {
  /* here '&' got replaced with its parent element name */
  padding: 2px 8px;
}

.main .main_para {
  /* #{&} it is like expression which signifies recursive parent tree element specification  */
  color: 'blue';
}
```

## Partials

Partials are files prefixed with `_` and with extension `.scss` these files do not get complied to css directly but the content of the files get transpiled and will be included in the files which imports specific partial files.

**\_reset.scss**

```scss
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

Like above are the content of the file named `_reset.scss`. Now we import this partial file in `main.scss` file.

```scss
@import 'reset'; /* look how we are not adding _ while importing */
.main {
  border: 2px black solid;
}
```

Now above `main.scss` file will be transpiled to

```css
/* the contents of the partial files are compiled and added in the main file */
* {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
* a {
  text-decoration: none;
}

.main {
  border: 2px black solid;
}
```

## @function

We can also write functions in SCSS which returns some value.

```scss
$colors: (
  'red': '#FF0000',
  'blue': '#0000FF',
  'green': '#00FF00',
);

@function colorIt($color_name) {
  @return map-get($colors, $color_name);
}

.main {
  color: colorIt('red');
}
```

it will get complied to

```css
.main {
  color: '#FF0000';
}
```

## @mixin

Mixins are like function which can take arguments but it does not return some value but it returns compiled styles it self. Also you have to include mixin.

```scss
@mixin flexCenterWithDirection($direction: 'row') {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: $direction;
}
.main {
  @include flexCenterWithDirection('column');
}
```

Above code will be transpiled to

```css
.main {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Basic rule for how to choose between functiona and mixin is when you want to get some value use function and when
you want to return style use mixin.

## @extend

We can extend any css code block and overwrite the stylings defined in it. It increases code reusability.

```scss
.main {
  &_para {
    color: white;
    background: black;
    &:hover {
      color: red;
    }
  }

  &_para2 {
    @extend .main_para; /* we are adding .main as & will be compiled to .main */
    &:hover {
      color: blue;
    }
  }
}
```

Above File will be transpiled to

```css
.main_para,
.main_para2 {
  color: white;
  background: black;
}
.main_para:hover,
.main_para2:hover {
  color: red;
}
.main_para2:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

## other extra bit of info

### math operation

`width: calc(80%-40%);` in css can be written as `width: 80%-40%;` in scss. But this is only valid if the units are same otherwise it wont work and we will have to fallback to `calc()`.

### @if @else

We can also use if else expression in scss checkout [docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) for more.

## Bonus Example

```scss
@mixin mobile($size) {
  @media (max-width: $size) {
    @content;
  }
}
.main {
  width: 42rem;
  @include mobile(800px) {
    /* all the styles defined here will be returned if the @media is satisfied */
    /* as the @content returns it */
    width: 15rem;
  }
}
```

It will be compiled to

```css
.main {
  width: 42rem;
}
@media (max-width: 800px) {
  .main {
    /* all the styles defined here will be returned if the @media is satisfied */
    /* as the @content returns it */
    width: 15rem;
  }
}
```
