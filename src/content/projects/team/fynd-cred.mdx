# <HoverUnder color="border-yellow-400">Fynds Cred Extention</HoverUnder>

An Extention for [CRED](https://cred.club/) on [Fynd platform](https://www.fynd.com/). We had to build a extention for CRED on [Fynd platform](https://www.fynd.com/platform/supply-chain/distributed-order-management-system) with which the CRED seller or CREDs client can handle their inventory and can track orders progress and can manage it🧑‍💻.

So we were provided with extension template from fynd team and all the apis from CRED, and then we were asked to bridge🌉 the CRED apis with Fynds template extention such with all the features asked from CRED.
